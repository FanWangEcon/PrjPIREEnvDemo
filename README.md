In this project, we investigate whether children in different groups experience different *exposures* to climate and environmental risks.

To what degree do children in marginalized socioeconomic and demographic groups experience different exposures to climate risks and air pollution? Mounting evidence over the past several decades has demonstrated the inequitable distribution of air pollution at the intersection of geographic and sociodemographic groups in developed countries. We aim to investigate air pollution, extreme temperature, and other potential negative environmental factor exposure disparities throughout the globe.

We develop novel group-based environmental measures to investigate the distributional patterns of ambient environmental measures among intersecting regional and sociodemographic groups. We aim to link global environmental estimates based on satellite remote sensing to global population data from the past 20 to 30 years. We will investigate changes in relative environmental exposures over time,  variations within and across countries and population groups, and how relative exposures across a range of potential negative environmental factors correlate.

This is a part of Project "Climate risk, pollution, and childhood inequalities in low- and middle-income countries" ([NSF Award 2230615](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2230615)).
